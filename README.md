## Installation

### Composer

If you already have Composer installed, you can just execute an update (because the composer.json is provided).
Navigate in terminal to the tdt-UI folder and execute the following command:

``` bash
$ composer update
```

### Configuration

Before starting to use the UI, you will need to copy index.example.json (in the public folder) and name it index.json. HOSTNAME and STARTPATH variables still need to be set in index.php.
